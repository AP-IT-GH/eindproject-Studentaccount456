# 2. ML-Agents documentation

## A. Goal ML-Agents

The agents need to be able:

- To find the player and try to catch him.
  \
   _Meaning: The agent needs to be able to navigate through the environment and its obstacles. While doing this he needs to find the player and catch him._
- To surround the player as a group with the second agent.
  \
  _Meaning: The agent needs to work together with a second agent to close in on the player at the same time._
